# Canary Deployments with Istio

### Install Istio

Download latest release:

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -
```

Add the istioctl client to your PATH:

```bash
cd istio-0.7.1
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

Install Istio services without enabling mutual TLS authentication:

```bash
kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio.yaml
``` 

### Set Istio automatic sidecar injection

Generate certs:

```bash
./install/kubernetes/webhook-create-signed-cert.sh \
    --service istio-sidecar-injector \
    --namespace istio-system \
    --secret sidecar-injector-certs
```

Install the sidecar injection configmap:

```bash
kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-sidecar-injector-configmap-release.yaml
```

Set the caBundle in the webhook install YAML that the Kubernetes api-server uses to invoke the webhook:

```bash
cat install/kubernetes/istio-sidecar-injector.yaml | \
     ./install/kubernetes/webhook-patch-ca-bundle.sh > \
     install/kubernetes/istio-sidecar-injector-with-ca-bundle.yaml
```

Install the sidecar injector webhook:

```bash
kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-sidecar-injector-with-ca-bundle.yaml
```

Create the `test` namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace test
```

Label the `test` namespace with `istio-injection=enabled`:

```bash
kubectl label namespace test istio-injection=enabled
```

### Run GA and Canary Deployments

Apply the podinfo ga and canary deployments and service:

```bash
kubectl -n test apply -f ./deploy/istio-v1alpha3/ga-dep.yaml,./deploy/istio-v1alpha3/canary-dep.yaml,./deploy/istio-v1alpha3/svc.yaml
```

Apply the istio destination rule, virtual service and gateway:

```bash
kubectl -n test apply -f ./deploy/istio-v1alpha3/istio-destination-rule.yaml
kubectl -n test apply -f ./deploy/istio-v1alpha3/istio-virtual-service.yaml
kubectl -n test apply -f ./deploy/istio-v1alpha3/istio-gateway.yaml
```

Create a `loadtest` pod for testing:

```bash
kubectl -n test run -i --rm --tty loadtest --image=stefanprodan/loadtest --restart=Never -- sh
```

Start the load test:

```bash
hey -n 1000000 -c 2 -q 5 http://podinfo.test:9898/version
```

**Initial state**

All traffic is routed to the GA deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: test
spec:
  hosts:
  - podinfo
  - podinfo.co.uk
  gateways:
  - mesh
  - podinfo-gateway
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: canary
      weight: 0
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: ga
      weight: 100
```

**Canary warm-up**

Route 10% of the traffic to the canary deployment:

```yaml
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: canary
      weight: 10
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: ga
      weight: 90
```

**Canary promotion**

Increase the canary traffic to 60%:

```yaml
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: canary
      weight: 60
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: ga
      weight: 40
```

![s3](https://github.com/stefanprodan/k8s-podinfo/blob/master/docs/screens/istio-c-s3.png)

Full promotion, 100% of the traffic to the canary:

```yaml
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: canary
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        name: podinfo.test
        subset: ga
      weight: 0
```

### Applying GitOps

![gitops](https://github.com/stefanprodan/k8s-podinfo/blob/master/docs/diagrams/istio-gitops.png)

Prerequisites for automating Istio canary deployments:

* create a cluster config Git repo that contains the desire state of your cluster
* keep the GA and Canary deployment definitions in Git 
* keep the Istio destination rule, virtual service and gateway definitions in Git
* any changes to the above resources are performed via `git commit` instead of `kubectl apply`

Assuming that the GA is version `0.1.0` and the Canary is at `0.2.0`, you would probably 
want to automate the deployment of patches for 0.1.x and 0.2.x. 

Using Weave Cloud you can define a GitOps pipeline that will continuously monitor for new patches 
and will apply them on both GA and Canary deployments using Weave Flux filters:

* `0.1.*` for GA
* `0.2.*` for Canary

Let's assume you've found a performance issue on the Canary by monitoring the request latency graph, for 
some reason the Canary is responding slower than the GA. 

CD GitOps pipeline steps:

* An engineer fixes the latency issue and cuts a new release by tagging the master branch as 0.2.1
* GitHub notifies GCP Container Builder that a new tag has been committed
* GCP Container Builder builds the Docker image, tags it as 0.2.1 and pushes it to Google Container Registry
* Weave Flux detects the new tag on GCR and updates the Canary deployment definition
* Weave Flux commits the Canary deployment definition to GitHub in the cluster repo
* Weave Flux triggers a rolling update of the Canary deployment
* Weave Cloud sends a Slack notification that the 0.2.1 patch has been released 

Once the Canary is fixed you can keep increasing the traffic shift from GA by modifying the weight setting 
and committing the changes in Git. Weave Cloud will detect that the cluster state is out of sync with 
desired state described in git and will apply the changes. 

If you notice that the Canary doesn't behave well under load you can revert the changes in Git and 
Weave Flux will undo the weight settings by applying the desired state from Git on the cluster.

Keep iterating on the Canary code until the SLA is on a par with the GA release.
